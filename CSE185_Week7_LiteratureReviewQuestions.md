Please replace the content of this file with 10 questions, due by your lab time on Tuesday, May 15.

1. How come there was no ZRS sequence present in corn snakes?
2. How far upstream are the Hox genes, and how far are they from Shh?
3. Which genes and enhancers are crucial to limb formation other than Shh?
4. Where is the difference between the python and cobra; such that the python has rudimentary digits.
5. The serpentized mouse is one with a snake ZRS region? 
6. What do the deleted 17-bp of snakes code for amino acid wise?
7. How was evolutionary rate measured?
8. How come the corn snake is missing such a large portion of the ZRS surrounding regions?
9. Why do the ETS binding sites show such constraint in paired limb vertebrates?
10. Why do homeodomain TFs display a similar loss of limb substitution in snakes?
